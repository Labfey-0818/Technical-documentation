                <p>In the world of programming, two languages often come up in discussions: JavaScript and Java. Despite their similar names, these two languages serve very different purposes. In this article, we’ll explore the core features, common uses, and key differences between JavaScript and Java, providing a clear understanding of each language’s strengths.</p>
                <p>JavaScript is a high-level scripting language commonly used for enhancing web interactivity and dynamic content. Originally developed to run in web browsers, JavaScript now powers both client-side and server-side applications, making it an essential tool for modern web developers. Its dynamic typing, event-driven nature, and asynchronous programming capabilities enable fast, responsive user experiences, particularly when paired with frameworks like React and Node.js.</p>

                    <h3>What is Java?</h3>
                    <p>Java is a versatile, powerful programming language known for its simplicity, reliability, and cross-platform capabilities. Originally developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1990s, Java quickly became popular for its "write once, run anywhere" philosophy. This means that Java applications can run on any system with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it a go-to choice for building everything from desktop applications to large-scale enterprise systems.</p>
                    <br><p>With a focus on object-oriented principles, Java enables developers to create reusable, modular code. It is designed to be secure, with built-in features like automatic memory management and garbage collection, which help reduce errors and improve program stability. Java’s extensive standard library, robust error-handling mechanisms, and strong typing system make it particularly well-suited for complex applications where reliability is critical.</p>
                    <br><p>Java is widely used across various domains, including web development (through frameworks like Spring), Android app development, and data-driven enterprise applications. Its ability to support multithreading and handle large-scale operations makes it ideal for applications that require high performance and scalability.</p>
                    <h3>Example Code: </h3>
                    <pre id="javacode">
                        <code>
                public class Main {
                    public static void main(String[] args) {
                        String name = "Alice";
                            System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
                            }
                        }

                    <p>JavaScript is a dynamic, high-level programming language that has become essential in web development. Initially created by Netscape in 1995 to add interactivity to web pages, JavaScript has since evolved into a versatile language that runs both on the client side, powering web interfaces and user interactions, and on the server side, enabling backend development with frameworks like Node.js. JavaScript's flexibility, along with its ability to work seamlessly with HTML and CSS, has made it the backbone of modern web applications.</p><br>
                    <p>One of JavaScript's most powerful features is its event-driven, asynchronous nature, which allows web pages to respond to user actions and update content without needing to reload. This is achieved through tools like promises and async/await syntax, which handle tasks such as fetching data from servers or managing animations. This enables developers to create responsive, engaging user experiences that load quickly and function smoothly.</p><br>
                    <p>Beyond the browser, JavaScript is now used in desktop and mobile app development and even in machine learning and IoT applications. Its vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, like React, Vue, and Express, provides developers with the tools needed to create robust, scalable applications. With an active community and ever-growing resources, JavaScript remains a powerful language for anyone looking to build interactive, high-performing digital experiences.</p><br>

            <h3>Javascript Key features: </h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Dynamic Typing: JavaScript does not require variable types to be defined, making it flexible and fast for scripting.</p></li>
                <li><p>Event-Driven and Asynchronous: JavaScript’s event-driven model enables it to respond to user actions in real time, while asynchronous programming through async/await and promises allows for smooth, non-blocking tasks.</p></li>
                <li><p>Prototype-Based Inheritance: JavaScript uses prototype-based inheritance, where objects can directly inherit from other objects.</p></li>
                <li><p>Cross-Browser Compatibility: JavaScript can run on almost any web browser, ensuring wide compatibility across devices.</p></li>
                <li><p>Versatile Ecosystem: JavaScript has a rich set of frameworks and libraries like React, Vue, and Node.js, allowing it to be used for front-end, back-end, and even mobile development.</p></li>
